{"text": " Social media shows a disfigured image of a reality that doesn't exist, because most people have a delicate life. So, that demand often comes from comparing yourself to others. Because when you compare yourself to someone, you don't compare yourself to what you were before. You compare yourself to your vulnerable side. And you're looking for a model of success that imitates that many times it doesn't even exist. You're looking at social media as a model of success. You interpret that woman or that successful man who is posing with her husband in a romantic way and with three perfectly peined children, dressed in the same way and happy face, you make a series of conclusions. This woman has to be super healthy and she has to have a super romantic life. With young people, I'm sure they're going to be phenomenal and they have a lot of complicity. She must be super empowered. When I'm exhausted and I can't live with it, right? You make those conclusions and you think, well, I want to be like her. And you try to imitate that thinking that that's success. Of course, when you see that you can't achieve what the photo transmits to you, what you think is, I'm not at the height.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.6000000000000005,
